# Git and GitHub Workshop

## 28 September 2020

### A. Introduction
*NOTE: Please take notes (on paper -> then type them to file; or directly into a text file).*

#### 1. What is Git?
+ It is a distributed **version control system**.
+ It is a program, invented by Linus Torvalds (the "father" of Linux).
+ It allows keeping track of the changes in a project (i.e. a whole folder with several folders and/or files simultaneously -> it tacks changes in a collection of files simultaneously).
+ It allows the revision and restoring of files from previous versions.

#### 2. What is GitHub
+ It is a Git repository.
+ It is a distributed code-hosting platform for version control and collaboration.
+ Open source oriented.

#### 3. Files and Filesystems
+ **Drives** (permanent storage) -> physical system = Hardware
+ **Volume** is a partition of a drive that can contain a filesystem.
+ There are mainly two categories of file formats: **Binary** and **Text files**.
+ The Encoding of text files is a table that maps binary code to characters/symbols (letters, digits, punctuation, etc). E.g. ASCII, UTF8, UTF16, etc.  
+ In text files, 1 byte = 8 bits = 1 character.
+ This allows 2^8 different combinations (256 possible character combinations).
